		For the second time: According to the Oxford English Dictionary, integrity, in a moral sense, is:
		Soundness of moral principle; the character of uncorrupted virtue, especially in relation to truth and fair dealing; uprightness, honesty, sincerity.
		Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.
		- Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955)
